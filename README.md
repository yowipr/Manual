# Manual

![Screenshot of Manual](https://manualai.art/manual.jpg "Manual")
Manual is an advanced user interface built on the ComfyUI backend. I developed it from scratch to be compatible with any AI that will be created in the future (and it's still a work in progress). I've written 100,000 lines of code for this project.

## Platforms

-   Windows only (for now).

## Use

-   Download the [**Manual_Portable.zip**](https://github.com/yowipr/Manual/releases/download/1.0.0-beta/Manual_Portable.zip).
-   or in Civitai: https://civitai.com/models/644188/manual
-   Copy and paste the ComfyUI folder path into Manual by navigating to Editor -> Preferences.
-   In the bottom right corner, click the circle, choose Open Local Server, and wait until the server starts (the circle will turn blue).
-   In the Latent Nodes Editor, click View -> Refresh to load your nodes and models.
-   Select the models and LoRa you have downloaded and wish to use.
-   You need **ComfyUI-Manual custom node** in ComfyUI: [ComfyUI-Manual](https://github.com/yowipr/ComfyUI-Manual).
-   Write a prompt, click generate, and you're done. Enjoy all the tools!

## What's Special About Manual

Manual stands out due to its advanced user experience and seamless integration of tools. Key features include:

-   **Universal AI Compatibility:** Works with all AI models, ensuring broad compatibility and flexibility.
-   **Unified Workflow Integration:** Keeps your models seamlessly integrated across all workflows and tools, enhancing consistency and efficiency.
-   **Custom Drivers:** Ensures your models work seamlessly across various tools and platforms.
-   **Enhanced Functionality:** Access to advanced features not commonly found in standard interfaces.

## Considerations

-   The tools in Manual work with SDXL; however, consider changing the CLIP Encoders to use a different AI.
-   To make all the tools work, you'll need some additional custom nodes from ComfyUI:
    -   [ComfyUI Impact Pack](https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Impact-Pack)
    -   [ComfyUI Essentials](https://github.com/cubiq/ComfyUI_essentials)
    -   [ComfyUI ControlNet Aux](https://github.com/Fannovel16/comfyui_controlnet_aux)
    -   Manual projects do not save generation history (the editor on the right); always place your images in layers.

## Licence

-   Free. Commercial use allowed. Enjoy it!
-   I am not responsible for what you generate with Manual.
-   Period.

## What's Next

-   The software is in beta, so feedback is appreciated.
-   For suggestions or assistance, you can reach me on [**Discord**](https://discord.gg/msKBTgu8Ca).
-   Contributions are welcome if you're a programmer or have ideas.

## Goals

-   Make AI accessible for everyone.
-   Establish AI as a standard tool for professional artwork, films, anime, etc.
