# Manual
Manual is an advanced UI using ComfyUI as backend.
I programmed it from the ground up to work with any AI that will be created (and still in progress). I did 100k lines of code.
This initially supposed to be a paid app, but since it's impossible to monetize in my situation, I decided to give it for free.

# Platforms:
- Windows only (for now)

# Use:
- in preferences you need to copy and paste the ComfyUI folder path
- in the bottom right corner, there are a circle, click and choose Open Local Server, and wait until the server starts, the circle will turn blue
- in the Latent Nodes Editor, click view -> Refresh, to load your nodes and models
- be sure to select a model that you have downloaded
- write a prompt, click generate, done

# Considerations:
- manual proyects doesn't save the generation History (the editor in the right), always put your images in layers

# Licence:
- Free Commercial use, Enjoy it
- I am not responsible for what you generate with Manual
- period.

# What's next:
- the software is in beta, so feedback would be appreciated
- if you have a suggestion or need help, you can ask me in discord: https://discord.gg/msKBTgu8Ca
- you can also contribute if you are a programmer or have ideas

# Goals:
- make AI accesible for everyone
- converting AI as standard for profesional artworks, Films, Anime, etc

*Made with love.*
